# History

This shaderpack was created after spending years modifying other shaderpacks, primarily [SEUS](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1280299). Ebin was created as a reaction to the many issues and inefficiencies within SEUS (which is by no means a bad shaderpack, it was probably the best shaderpack during the inception of Ebin). Developments within the Shaders Mod, such as its adoption by Optifine, and the addition of the #include preprocessor, boosted motivation to develop a more "modern" shaderpack.
