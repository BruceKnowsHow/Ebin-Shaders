# Ebin Shaders

This is a Minecraft shaderpack for use with [Optifine](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1272953). Ebin is aiming to provide maximum performance, configurability, and visual quality. Whether you want to create easy scenic screenshots to post on reddit, film a complex Minecraft cinematic, or play on a competitive multiplayer server, Ebin is intended to accommodate all these situations, and more.

## Features
- Shadows / Shading - the basics
- Global Illumination
- Bloom / Glow
- Motion Blur
- Procedural 2D Clouds
- Procedural Water
- Screen Space Reflections
- Terrain Parallax - 3D blocks with a supported texture pack
- Multi-Layered Shading Pipeline - Everything is correctly shaded, even behind semi-transparent blocks
- Time Override - you can force it to be daytime on a multiplayer server
- Terrain Deformation - "Animal Crossing" and "Acid" deformations

## Requirements
- A recent version of Optifine
- Hardware that supports OpenGL 4.1

# History

This shaderpack was created by me, [BruceKnowsHow](https://github.com/BruceKnowsHow), after spending years modifying other shaderpacks, primarily [SEUS](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1280299), for my own personal use. I created Ebin as a reaction to the many issues and inefficiencies within SEUS (which is by no means a bad shaderpack, it was probably the best shaderpack during inception of Ebin). Developments within the Shaders Mod, such as its adoption by Optifine, and the addition of the #include preprocessor, boosted my motivation to develop a more "modern" shaderpack.
