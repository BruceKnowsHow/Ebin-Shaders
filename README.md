This is a shaderpack for use with the [Minecraft GLSL Shaders Mod,](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1286604) or recent versions of [Optifine.](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1272953) In fact, this shaderpack incorporates recent developments exclusive to Optifine's implementation of the GLSL shaders, namely the #include preprocessor, so this shaderpack doesn't technically support the GLSL Shaders Mod.

This shaderpack was created after spending a lot of time editing [Sonic Ether's Unbelievable Shaders.](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1280299) I learned what I know about GLSL mostly from editing SUES, therefore this shaderpack is in some ways highly derivative of SUES.

This shaderpack is still a massive work in progress.
