// Enable the above lines by removing the double-slashes "//"
// in front of the them. Make sure exactly one line is always
// enabled. Enabling the "uniform float" line will decrease
// your FPS by about 33%, and it is only necessary for the
// "center-focus" mode of the "telefocal shadow" feature.
